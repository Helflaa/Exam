Project Brief: 

Blog Feed page

- As a user, I want to see an interactive banner carousel on the blog feed page, so that I can view a rotation of the 3 latest posts.
- As a user, I want to click on a button for each carousel item, taking me to the blog post page to read more.
- As a user, I want to click on the previous or next button in the carousel to animate and reveal another post, to ensure I can see different posts easily.
- As a user, I want the carousel to return to the first post after reaching the end of the list, and vice versa when clicking previous on the first post.
- As a user, I want to view a static list of the 12 latest posts in a responsive thumbnail grid on the blog feed page, so I can easily select which post to read.
- As a user, I want each thumbnail in the blog post feed to be clickable, taking me to the blog post page to read more.

  
Block Post Public Page

- As a user, I want to see a responsive layout showing the post title, author, publication date, image banner, and post content from the API.
- as a user, I want each blog page to have a shareable URL including a query string or hash parameter that contains the post ID, so I can share the post with others easily.

  
Blog Post Edit Page

- As the owner, I want the blog post edit page to be available only for me when logged in, to ensure no unauthorized edits can be made to my posts.
- As the owner, I want a delete button that sends a DELETE request to the API for this post ID on the edit page, so I can easily remove my post if needed.
- As the owner, I want a validated edit form that allows me to update the title, body content, or image by sending a POST request to the API for this post ID, ensuring I can keep my posts up to date easily.
Abbount Login Page

- As the owner, I want a validated login form that allows me to request and save a token to my browser by entering my email and password, allowing me to manage posts.
